{title}Improving .NET Solition Structure: Code Isolation

[*Sergey A Kryukov*](https://www.SAKryukov.org)

How to find out whether the Earth is flat or not? Just use the presented application and a digital camera.

The Earth's flatness (curvature) measurements are performed using a digital camera based on statistical processing of the big set of photographed features, taking into account atmospheric refraction, lens distortion, geolocation, and accelerometer data. The result is calculated automatically. The image recognition methods can use the patterns of the surface ocean waves, sand dunes, clouds, and the color gradients of the clear blue sky.

## Introduction

This is the first article of the projected diptych of two article on the .NET solution structure:

1. *Present article*
2. *[Improving .NET Solition Structure: WPF](https://www.codeproject.com/???)*

The present article discusses the most common problems and suggested solutions.

Both article and the current snapshot of the code can be found in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAKryukov/dotnet-solution-structure).
